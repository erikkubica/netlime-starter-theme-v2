Theme will be singleton, so migrate all code from netlime instance to Theme

Plugins will be normal class, extended from a plugins base which will have some base functions
like get config and other that is actually in netllime instance.

Theme will init modules into protected variable, that will be accessed using like theme()->get("plugin")->getImage();

using render we should also inject the self::$instance as $context and use $context::get("plugin")->getImage();

Reason Everything being a singleton is little dump, even if it looks good.
